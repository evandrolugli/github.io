        <h1>Hey, I'm Evandro!</h1>
        <p>I've been a software developer since 2014 and have been making websites since 1998.</p>
        <p>This is my spot on the web for writing, projects, and anything else I want to put out there. Check out the <a href="#">github</a></p>
        <p>This site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. My motivation for this site is to have a space for self-expression and to share what I've learned with the world. I hope I will inspire others to make their own creative corner on the web as well.</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me by email at <a href="mailto:evandro.lugli@gmail.com">evandro.lugli@gmail.com</a> to say hi!</p>
